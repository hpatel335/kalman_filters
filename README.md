# Kalman Filters

## Overview 
Sensor fusion is a powerful processing framework that at its most fundamental level leverages multiple sources of information to produce an increasingly more reliable estimate than compared to any estimate that could be drawn by the same sources in isolation. Sensor fusion techniques are widly appled for robotic applications, especially for systems which require a high accuracy of state estimation. While there are a number of different algorithms, this walkthrough will focus on *kalman filters*. This project should serve to demonstrate just how useful kalman filters can be for multisensor systems, and provide an introductory understanding of their implimentation.
